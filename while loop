# A 'while' loop continues as long as its condition is True.
# If the condition NEVER becomes false, you get an infinite loop!

# DANGEROUS CODE:

# YOUR CODE HERE - Simple guessing game:
# 1. Create a variable `secret_number = 7`.
# 2. Create a variable `guess = 0`.
# 3. Use a `while` loop that continues as long as `guess` is NOT equal to `secret_number`.
# 4. Inside the loop, ask the user to guess the number and store it in the `guess` variable.
#    (Remember to convert the input to an integer!)
# 5. After the loop ends (meaning they guessed correctly), print "You got it!".
# YOUR CODE HERE:

secret_number = 7
guess = 0
while guess != secret_number:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
    if guess == secret_number:
        print("You got it!")
