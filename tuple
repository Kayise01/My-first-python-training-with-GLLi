# A tuple is like a list, but it CANNOT be changed after it's created. It's "immutable".
# You create them with parentheses ().
# Use them for data that should not change, like coordinates or fixed settings.

# A tuple of RGB color values for "red"
red_color = (255, 0, 0)

# red_color[0] = 200  # This is not allowed!

# YOUR CODE HERE - Work with a coordinate point:
# 1. Create a tuple named `point` to represent an (x, y) coordinate, e.g., (150, 250).
# 2. Print the entire tuple.
# 3. Print a sentence: "The x-coordinate is [your x value] and the y-coordinate is [your y value]."
# YOUR CODE HERE:

point = (150, 250)
print("The coordinate point is:", point)
print(f"The x-coordinate is {point[0]} and the y-coordinate is {point[1]}.")
